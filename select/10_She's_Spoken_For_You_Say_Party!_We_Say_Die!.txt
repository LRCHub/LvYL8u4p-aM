It's my body
Not made for this world
Give my body
A host in this world
Take my body
Others will
Lose my body
Into this world
Into this world
Into this world

Trust trust in me, trust trust in me
It'll be easy
It'll be easier
And it is love

It's my mind, it's my mind
Not made for this world
Give my mind, give my mind
A house in this world
Take my mind, take my mind
All others will
Use my mind, use my mind
Into this world
Into this world
Into this world

Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
It'll be easy
It'll be easier
And it is love

Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
It'll be easy
Remember me first
When you can't have

It's my spirit, it's my spirit
Not made for this world, not made for this world
Give my spirit, give my spirit
A house in this world
Take my spirit, take my spirit
Then out of this world
Use my spirit, use my spirit
Into this world
Into this world
Into this world

Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
Trust trust in me
