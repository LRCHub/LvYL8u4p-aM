Wake up
Morning set in motion for me
Clear cut
Put on the emotion guaranteed
And when they drag me by my feet
Pick me up and march me to the beat
Make me complete
I'm miles above the street
Staring as I pass me by,
My self-deceit
And I breathe
Nothing but a shadow, it seems
Caught up in routine
Can they see the person beneath
The days go by so uniformly
Tightly controlled and
determined for me, yeah
Showered in fame, my fans adore me
Only way to fuck it up
is to be boring
I don't get the messages,
they don't come to me
Everything that I can say
is spoken for me, yeah
Get up
Afternoon is nauseous again
Get fucked
God, I'm so pathetic
And when I rip you out my chest
Won't you realize you're
just obsessed?
A fraud at best
Drain the blood from this abscess
Watch me as I eat my heart out,
dispossessed
But I breathe
Something's got me doubting,
it seems
Am I anything?
Am I even a person beneath?
The daze of bloodstains,
cruel and gory
Visions of violence
are overpowering, yeah
Puking my guts out almost hourly
Shaving off the numbers
of this fucking body
I can't read the messages,
they come so quickly
Please I'm begging anybody
come and save me
I don't get the messages,
they don't come to me
Everything that I can say
is spoken for me, yeah
I could be a friend, or
I could be a foe
You make the decision,
and that's all I know
Oh, I could be a sinner
I could be a saint
Perfectly devoid of
anything I ain't
I could be a martyr
I could be a cause
I can be whatever
everybody wants
Oh, I could be a canvas
I could be a doll
I don't think I'm even
something real at all
I could be a woman
I could be a man
Look into the mirror,
tell me what I am
Oh, I could be a difference
I could be the same
Try to give me meaning,
it's a losing game
Oh, I could go to heaven
I could go to hell
Does it even matter?
I could never tell
Oh, maybe I am nothing
Maybe I am all
Baby, make me something
'fore I get that call 'cause
I CAN'T HEAR THE MESSAGES,
THEY JUST DON'T LET ME
I CAN'T BEAR THE SOLITARY,
DON'T FORGET ME
I CAN'T READ THE MESSAGES,
THEY COME SO SLOWLY
I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING
AND I'M SO LONELY
I DON'T GET THE MESSAGES,
THEY DON'T COME TO ME
EVERYTHING THAT I CAN SAY
IS SPOKEN FOR ME, YEAH
