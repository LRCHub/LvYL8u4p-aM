Your frame
Walks into the window
Giving me a picture
Of what I already know
In the darkness
Baby you sit so close
Press your hand up against mine
But only with the lights low

We're so good at playing games
What happens when it's over?
After a drink you say my name
But forget me when you're sober

I'm thinking we're over
I know I'll never get closure
No cause you're spoken for
No cause you're spoken for

I'm thinking it over
Wonder if you ever told her
No cause you're spoken for
No cause you're spoken for

You call
I don't pick up at all
I got nothing left to say
Better stop saying my name
Every time she leaves town
You come running back around
I know I should say no
We lose control with the lights low

We're so good at playing games
What happens when it's over?
After a drink you say my name
But forget me when you're sober

I'm thinking we're over
I know I'll never get closure
No cause you're spoken for
No cause you're spoken for

I'm thinking it over
Wonder if you ever told her
No cause you're spoken for
No cause you're spoken for

We're so good at playing games
But what happens when we're over?

You forget me when you're sober
