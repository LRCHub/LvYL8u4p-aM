One, two, one, two, one, two, three!

Does your family have any history
of addiction or succumbing to guys like me?
was your father the type to say things right?
or was your mother the type to spend the night?

'cuz i get the feeling that you're buying time
ironically enough, as you spark that light
you order two more shots, but don't wait for the lime
down go your last two reasons to lie

does your conscience keep you up at night screaming out:
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
does your conscience keep you up at night screaming out:
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!

can you feel their stares?

cross your fingers
and hope he doesn't wait up for you
'cuz my touch lingers
and it will be written all over you
cross your fingers
and hope he buys all the shit you feed him
'cuz that taste lingers
when he's gone and you still need him

this is dirty water
but its still something worth drinking down
if it can cure my dehydration
from the words you let slip out

'cuz we've got dirty laundry
and we've got closets with hinges that beg
to bust and expose us
for the people in the elevator

does your conscience keep you up at night screaming out:
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
does your conscience keep you up at night screaming out:
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!
WE KNOW! WE KNOW!

cross your fingers
and hope he doesn't wait up for you
'cuz my touch lingers
and it will be written all over you
cross your fingers
and hope he buys all the shit you feed him
'cuz that taste lingers
when he's gone and you still need him

and then he gets the feeling that you're buying time
as you struggle like a teen to spark that light
you order two more shots, but don't wait for the lime
down go your last two reasons to lie

cross your fingers
and hope he doesn't wait up for you
'cuz my touch lingers
and it will be written all over you
cross your fingers
and hope he buys all the shit you feed him
'cuz that taste lingers
when he's gone and you still need him
