Spoken For
The lady's been
Spoken For

More and more
I find I adore her

She's mine to miss
The lady is mine to miss
And I know what
A careless kiss can do

I know I'll never forget her
I'll act my age
And behave

I'll set a flame to her letters
Just like they do on the stage

Laughing eyes
The lady has laughing eyes
Paradise
Can never be mine

So I'll stand back
And be one of the pack
And want her each day
More and more

Cause the lady I love
Has been spoken for

So I'll stand back
And be one of the pack
And want her each day
More and more

Cause the lady I love
Has been spoken for
